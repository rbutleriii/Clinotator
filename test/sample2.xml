                <Attribute Type="public definition">HFE hemochromatosis is characterized by inappropriately high absorption of iron by the small intestinal mucosa. The phenotypic spectrum of HFE hemochromatosis includes: Persons with clinical HFE hemochromatosis, in whom manifestations of end-organ damage secondary to iron overload are present; Individuals with biochemical HFE hemochromatosis, in whom transferrin-iron saturation is increased and the only evidence of iron overload is increased serum ferritin concentration; and Non-expressing p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes, in whom neither clinical manifestations of HFE hemochromatosis nor iron overload are present. Clinical HFE hemochromatosis is characterized by excessive storage of iron in the liver, skin, pancreas, heart, joints, and anterior pituitary gland. In untreated individuals, early symptoms include: abdominal pain, weakness, lethargy, weight loss, arthralgias, diabetes mellitus; and increased risk of cirrhosis when the serum ferritin is higher than 1,000 ng/mL. Other findings may include progressive increase in skin pigmentation, congestive heart failure, and/or arrhythmias, arthritis, and hypogonadism. Clinical HFE hemochromatosis is more common in men than women.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">In patients with hemochromatosis (HFE1; 235200), Feder et al. (1996) identified an 845G-A transition in the HFE gene (which they referred to as HLA-H or 'cDNA 24'), resulting in a cys282-to-tyr (C282Y) substitution. This missense mutation occurs in a highly conserved residue involved in the intramolecular disulfide bridging of MHC class I proteins, and could therefore disrupt the structure and function of this protein. Using an allele-specific oligonucleotide-ligation assay on their group of 178 patients, they detected the C282Y mutation in 85% of all HFE chromosomes. In contrast, only 10 of the 310 control chromosomes (3.2%) carried the mutation, a carrier frequency of 10/155 = 6.4%. One hundred forty-eight of 178 HH patients were homozygous for this mutation, 9 were heterozygous, and 21 carried only the normal allele. These numbers were extremely discrepant from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The findings corroborated heterogeneity among the hemochromatosis patients, with 83% of cases related to C282Y homozygosity.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">Jazwinska et al. (1996) provided convincing evidence that the C282Y mutation in homozygous form in the HFE gene is the cause of hemochromatosis. In studies in Australia, patients properly characterized at the genotypic and phenotypic level all showed homozygosity for the C282Y substitution. Irrespective of haplotype, all HH heterozygotes were cys/tyr heterozygotes, and all homozygous normal controls were cys/cys homozygotes. The presence of a single mutation in all patients contrasted with the data of Feder et al. (1996), who reported a lower frequency of the mutation. Jazwinska et al. (1996) suggested that different clinical criteria for the diagnosis of HH may account for the difference, or that HH may not be as homogeneous as previously believed. They noted that a key question is why there is a variation in severity of iron loading in HH that is haplotype-related when the mutation is identical in all haplotypes tested. Jazwinska et al. (1996) hypothesized that the HFE locus is the primary HH locus, but that there are likely to be other 6p-linked modifying genes that would explain both the HLA-linked haplotype variation in expression of the disorder and the large region of linkage disequilibrium present in all populations and spanning at least 4.5 Mb distal of D6S265.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">Jouanolle et al. (1996) commented on the significance of the C282Y mutation on the basis of a group of 65 unrelated affected individuals who had been under study in France for more than 10 years and identified by stringent criteria. Homozygosity for the C282Y mutation was found in 59 of 65 patients (90.8%); 3 of the patients were compound heterozygotes for the C282Y mutation and the H63D mutation (613609.0002); 1 was homozygous for the H63D mutation; and 2 were heterozygous for H63D. These results corresponded to an allelic frequency of 93.1% for the C282Y and 5.4% for the H63D mutations, respectively. Of note, the C282Y mutation was never observed in the family-based controls, whereas it was present in 5.8% of the general Breton population. This corresponds to a theoretical frequency of about 1 per 1,000 for the disease, which is slightly lower than generally estimated. In contrast, the H63D allelic frequency was nearly the same in both control groups (15% and 16.5% in the family-based and general population controls, respectively). While the experience of Jouanolle et al. (1996) appeared to indicate a close relationship of C282Y to hemochromatosis, the implication of the H63D variant was not clear.</Attribute>

All of the C282Y homozygous patients were also homozygous for the wildtype nucleotide 187C (see H63D; 613609.0002), and all C282Y heterozygotes had at least 1 copy of 187C. Thus, the 2 nucleotides, 845 and 187, were in complete linkage disequilibrium; nucleotide 187 was a C on all chromosomes with the 845A (C282Y) mutation. Eight of the 10 heterozygotes for 845A were heterozygous for 187G (H63D).</Attribute>

The UK Haemochromatosis Consortium (1997) genotyped 115 unrelated hereditary hemochromatosis patients and found that 105 (91%) were homozygous for the C282Y mutation. One of 101 controls was also found to be homozygous but was subsequently found to have evidence of iron overload. Compound heterozygosity for the C282Y and H63D mutations was found in 3 patients who had mild disease and in 4 controls who had no signs of iron overload. Five patients lacked either mutation, 2 of whom had atypical, early-onset disease.</Attribute>

In vitro, the C282Y mutant HFE protein failed to associate with endogenous B2M in human embryonic kidney cells stably transfected with the mutant cDNA. Waheed et al. (1997) found that whereas the wildtype and H63D HFE proteins associate with beta-2 microglobulin and are expressed on the cell surface of COS-7 cells, these capabilities are lost by the C282Y HFE protein. They presented biochemical and immunofluorescence data indicating that the C282Y mutant protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and middle Golgi compartments, fails to undergo late Golgi processing, and is subject to accelerated degradation. The block in intracellular transport, accelerated turnover, and failure of the C282Y protein to be presented normally on the cell surface provides a possible basis for impaired function of this mutant protein in hereditary hemochromatosis.</Attribute>

(1997) investigated the relationships between the hemochromatosis phenotype and genotypes at the HLA-H locus and surrounding markers. They found that the C282Y substitution is unambiguously associated with the hemochromatosis phenotype; 81.2% of all patients were homozygous. The subgroup of heterozygous individuals showed lower values for serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and iron removed by phlebotomy than did the subgroup of hemochromatosis patients homozygous for C282Y. In the subgroup not homozygous for C282Y, no other mutation in the HLA-H gene was found; hence, the genotype remained unclear. The authors suggested additional nongenetic cause, other mutations, or another gene as explanations for the results in these patients.</Attribute>

However, homozygosity for the mutation was detected in an asymptomatic and biochemically normal 50-year-old male sib of the affected individuals. Rhodes et al.

The geographic distribution supported the previously suggested Celtic origin of hemochromatosis. In contrast, the H63D substitution is not restricted to European populations. Although absent in the Senegalese, it was found on about 9% of the chromosomes of the central Ethiopians and Algerians genotyped for this study. Thus, the H63D substitution must have occurred earlier than the C282Y substitution.</Attribute>

Cullen et al. (1998) used PCR and restriction-enzyme digestion to analyze the frequency of the C282Y and H63D mutations in HLA-typed samples of non-Caucasian populations, comprising Australian Aboriginal, Chinese, and Pacific Islanders. They found that the C282Y mutation was present in these populations (allele frequency 0.32%), and that it was always seen in conjunction with HLA haplotypes common in Caucasians, suggesting that C282Y may have been introduced into these populations by Caucasian admixture. They found the H63D mutation at an allele frequency of 2.68% in the 2 populations analyzed (Australian Aboriginal and Chinese). In the Australian Aboriginal samples, H63D was found to be associated with HLA haplotypes common in Caucasians, again suggesting that it was introduced by recent admixture. In the Chinese samples analyzed, on the other hand, H63D was present in association with a wide variety of HLA haplotypes, showing that this mutation is widespread and likely to predate the more genetically restricted C282Y mutation.</Attribute>

The most common symptoms of hemochromatosis were no more prevalent among the 152 identified homozygotes than among the controls. The age distribution of homozygotes and compound heterozygotes did not differ significantly from that of controls; there was no measurable loss of such individuals from the population during aging. However, there was a significantly increased prevalence of a history of hepatitis or 'liver trouble' among homozygotes and in the proportion of homozygotes with increased concentrations of serum aspartate aminotransferase and collagen IV; these changes were not related to iron burden or to age. Only 1 of the 152 homozygotes had signs and symptoms that would suggest a diagnosis of hemochromatosis. Beutler et al.

The proportion of C282Y homozygotes with documented iron overload-related disease was 28.4% for men and 1.2% for women.

The authors examined the interaction between the C2 variant of the TF gene (190000.0004) and the C282Y allele of the HFE gene, the most common basis of hemochromatosis, as risk factors for developing AD. The results showed that each of the 2 variants was associated with an increased risk of AD only in the presence of the other. Neither allele alone had any effect. Carriers of both variants were at 5 times greater risk of AD compared with all others. Furthermore, carriers of these 2 alleles plus APOE4 (see 107741) were at still higher risk of AD: of the 14 carriers of the 3 variants identified in this study, 12 had AD and 2 had mild cognitive impairment.

(2004) concluded that their results indicated that the combination of TF*C2 and HFE C282Y may lead to an excess of redoxactive iron and the induction of oxidative stress in neurons, which is exacerbated in carriers of APOE4. They noted that 4% of northern Europeans carry the 2 iron-related variants and that iron overload is a treatable condition.</Attribute>

C282Y explained 9.5%, 9.1%, 13.2%, and 3.7% of the variation in means of serum iron, serum transferrin, transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin levels, respectively.

              <Attribute Type="Description">In patients with hemochromatosis (HFE1; 235200), Feder et al. (1996) identified an 845G-A transition in the HFE gene (which they referred to as HLA-H or 'cDNA 24'), resulting in a cys282-to-tyr (C282Y) substitution. This missense mutation occurs in a highly conserved residue involved in the intramolecular disulfide bridging of MHC class I proteins, and could therefore disrupt the structure and function of this protein. Using an allele-specific oligonucleotide-ligation assay on their group of 178 patients, they detected the C282Y mutation in 85% of all HFE chromosomes. In contrast, only 10 of the 310 control chromosomes (3.2%) carried the mutation, a carrier frequency of 10/155 = 6.4%. One hundred forty-eight of 178 HH patients were homozygous for this mutation, 9 were heterozygous, and 21 carried only the normal allele. These numbers were extremely discrepant from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The findings corroborated heterogeneity among the hemochromatosis patients, with 83% of cases related to C282Y homozygosity.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">Jazwinska et al. (1996) provided convincing evidence that the C282Y mutation in homozygous form in the HFE gene is the cause of hemochromatosis. In studies in Australia, patients properly characterized at the genotypic and phenotypic level all showed homozygosity for the C282Y substitution. Irrespective of haplotype, all HH heterozygotes were cys/tyr heterozygotes, and all homozygous normal controls were cys/cys homozygotes. The presence of a single mutation in all patients contrasted with the data of Feder et al. (1996), who reported a lower frequency of the mutation. Jazwinska et al. (1996) suggested that different clinical criteria for the diagnosis of HH may account for the difference, or that HH may not be as homogeneous as previously believed. They noted that a key question is why there is a variation in severity of iron loading in HH that is haplotype-related when the mutation is identical in all haplotypes tested. Jazwinska et al. (1996) hypothesized that the HFE locus is the primary HH locus, but that there are likely to be other 6p-linked modifying genes that would explain both the HLA-linked haplotype variation in expression of the disorder and the large region of linkage disequilibrium present in all populations and spanning at least 4.5 Mb distal of D6S265.</Attribute>

(1996) commented on the significance of the C282Y mutation on the basis of a group of 65 unrelated affected individuals who had been under study in France for more than 10 years and identified by stringent criteria. Homozygosity for the C282Y mutation was found in 59 of 65 patients (90.8%); 3 of the patients were compound heterozygotes for the C282Y mutation and the H63D mutation (613609.0002); 1 was homozygous for the H63D mutation; and 2 were heterozygous for H63D. These results corresponded to an allelic frequency of 93.1% for the C282Y and 5.4% for the H63D mutations, respectively. Of note, the C282Y mutation was never observed in the family-based controls, whereas it was present in 5.8% of the general Breton population. This corresponds to a theoretical frequency of about 1 per 1,000 for the disease, which is slightly lower than generally estimated. In contrast, the H63D allelic frequency was nearly the same in both control groups (15% and 16.5% in the family-based and general population controls, respectively). While the experience of Jouanolle et al. (1996) appeared to indicate a close relationship of C282Y to hemochromatosis, the implication of the H63D variant was not clear.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">Feder et al. (1997) confirmed the prediction that the C282Y mutation would disrupt a critical disulfide bond in the alpha-3 loop of the HFE protein and abrogate binding of the mutant HFE protein to beta-2-microglobulin (B2M; 109700), as well as its transport to and presentation on the cell surface. In vitro, the C282Y mutant HFE protein failed to associate with endogenous B2M in human embryonic kidney cells stably transfected with the mutant cDNA. Waheed et al. (1997) found that whereas the wildtype and H63D HFE proteins associate with beta-2 microglobulin and are expressed on the cell surface of COS-7 cells, these capabilities are lost by the C282Y HFE protein. They presented biochemical and immunofluorescence data indicating that the C282Y mutant protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and middle Golgi compartments, fails to undergo late Golgi processing, and is subject to accelerated degradation. The block in intracellular transport, accelerated turnover, and failure of the C282Y protein to be presented normally on the cell surface provides a possible basis for impaired function of this mutant protein in hereditary hemochromatosis.</Attribute>

(1997) investigated the relationships between the hemochromatosis phenotype and genotypes at the HLA-H locus and surrounding markers. They found that the C282Y substitution is unambiguously associated with the hemochromatosis phenotype; 81.2% of all patients were homozygous. The subgroup of heterozygous individuals showed lower values for serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and iron removed by phlebotomy than did the subgroup of hemochromatosis patients homozygous for C282Y. In the subgroup not homozygous for C282Y, no other mutation in the HLA-H gene was found; hence, the genotype remained unclear. The authors suggested additional nongenetic cause, other mutations, or another gene as explanations for the results in these patients.</Attribute>

Cullen et al.

They found that the C282Y mutation was present in these populations (allele frequency 0.32%), and that it was always seen in conjunction with HLA haplotypes common in Caucasians, suggesting that C282Y may have been introduced into these populations by Caucasian admixture. They found the H63D mutation at an allele frequency of 2.68% in the 2 populations analyzed (Australian Aboriginal and Chinese). In the Australian Aboriginal samples, H63D was found to be associated with HLA haplotypes common in Caucasians, again suggesting that it was introduced by recent admixture. In the Chinese samples analyzed, on the other hand, H63D was present in association with a wide variety of HLA haplotypes, showing that this mutation is widespread and likely to predate the more genetically restricted C282Y mutation.</Attribute>

The most common symptoms of hemochromatosis were no more prevalent among the 152 identified homozygotes than among the controls. The age distribution of homozygotes and compound heterozygotes did not differ significantly from that of controls; there was no measurable loss of such individuals from the population during aging. However, there was a significantly increased prevalence of a history of hepatitis or 'liver trouble' among homozygotes and in the proportion of homozygotes with increased concentrations of serum aspartate aminotransferase and collagen IV; these changes were not related to iron burden or to age. Only 1 of the 152 homozygotes had signs and symptoms that would suggest a diagnosis of hemochromatosis. Beutler et al.

(2004) analyzed the presence of the common mtDNA 16189T-C variant, which appears to be a risk factor for type 2 diabetes (125853), in British, French, and Australian C282Y homozygotes and controls, with known iron status, and in birth cohorts. The frequency of the 16189 variant was found to be elevated in individuals with hemochromatosis who were homozygous for the C282Y allele, compared with population controls and with C282Y homozygotes who were asymptomatic. They concluded that iron loading in C282Y homozygotes with hemochromatosis was exacerbated by the presence of the 16189 variant.</Attribute>

(2008) reported on a study of HFE mutations in 31,192 persons of northern European descent between ages 40 and 69 years who participated in the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study and were followed for an average of 12 years. In a random sample of 1,438 subjects stratified according to HFE genotype, including all 203 C282Y homozygotes (of whom 108 were women and 95 were men), they obtained clinical and biochemical data, including 2 sets of iron measurements performed 12 years apart. Disease related to iron overload was defined as documented iron overload and one or more of the following conditions: cirrhosis, liver fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, elevated aminotransferase levels, physician-diagnosed symptomatic hemochromatosis, and arthropathy of the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints. The proportion of C282Y homozygotes with documented iron overload-related disease was 28.4% for men and 1.2% for women. Only 1 non-C282Y homozygote (a compound heterozygote with his63 to asp) had documented iron overload-related disease. Male C282Y homozygotes with a serum ferritin level of 1,000 micrograms per liter or more were more likely to report fatigue, use of arthritis medicine, and a history of liver disease than were men who had the wildtype gene. Waalen and Beutler (2008) and Rienhoff (2008) commented that the study by Allen et al. (2008) may have overestimated the clinical prevalence and penetrance of iron-overload disease in C282Y homozygotes.</Attribute>

The first mutation deleted a large portion of the coding sequence, generating a null allele. The second mutation introduced the C282Y change into the Hfe gene but otherwise left the gene intact. Homozygosity for either mutation resulted in postnatal iron loading. The effects of the null mutation were more severe than the effects of the C282Y mutation. The mice heterozygous for either mutation accumulated more iron than normal controls. Although liver iron stores were greatly increased, splenic iron was decreased. Levy et al.

Thus, genetic factors that contribute to iron deposition resulting in tissue damage might exacerbate AD. The authors examined the interaction between the C2 variant of the TF gene (190000.0004) and the C282Y allele of the HFE gene, the most common basis of hemochromatosis, as risk factors for developing AD. The results showed that each of the 2 variants was associated with an increased risk of AD only in the presence of the other. Neither allele alone had any effect. Carriers of both variants were at 5 times greater risk of AD compared with all others. Furthermore, carriers of these 2 alleles plus APOE4 (see 107741) were at still higher risk of AD: of the 14 carriers of the 3 variants identified in this study, 12 had AD and 2 had mild cognitive impairment. Robson et al. (2004) concluded that their results indicated that the combination of TF*C2 and HFE C282Y may lead to an excess of redoxactive iron and the induction of oxidative stress in neurons, which is exacerbated in carriers of APOE4. They noted that 4% of northern Europeans carry the 2 iron-related variants and that iron overload is a treatable condition.</Attribute>

(1996) identified an 845G-A transition in the HFE gene (which they referred to as HLA-H or 'cDNA 24'), resulting in a cys282-to-tyr (C282Y) substitution. This missense mutation occurs in a highly conserved residue involved in the intramolecular disulfide bridging of MHC class I proteins, and could therefore disrupt the structure and function of this protein. Using an allele-specific oligonucleotide-ligation assay on their group of 178 patients, they detected the C282Y mutation in 85% of all HFE chromosomes. In contrast, only 10 of the 310 control chromosomes (3.2%) carried the mutation, a carrier frequency of 10/155 = 6.4%. One hundred forty-eight of 178 HH patients were homozygous for this mutation, 9 were heterozygous, and 21 carried only the normal allele. These numbers were extremely discrepant from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The findings corroborated heterogeneity among the hemochromatosis patients, with 83% of cases related to C282Y homozygosity.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">Jazwinska et al. (1996) provided convincing evidence that the C282Y mutation in homozygous form in the HFE gene is the cause of hemochromatosis. In studies in Australia, patients properly characterized at the genotypic and phenotypic level all showed homozygosity for the C282Y substitution. Irrespective of haplotype, all HH heterozygotes were cys/tyr heterozygotes, and all homozygous normal controls were cys/cys homozygotes. The presence of a single mutation in all patients contrasted with the data of Feder et al. (1996), who reported a lower frequency of the mutation. Jazwinska et al. (1996) suggested that different clinical criteria for the diagnosis of HH may account for the difference, or that HH may not be as homogeneous as previously believed. They noted that a key question is why there is a variation in severity of iron loading in HH that is haplotype-related when the mutation is identical in all haplotypes tested. Jazwinska et al. (1996) hypothesized that the HFE locus is the primary HH locus, but that there are likely to be other 6p-linked modifying genes that would explain both the HLA-linked haplotype variation in expression of the disorder and the large region of linkage disequilibrium present in all populations and spanning at least 4.5 Mb distal of D6S265.</Attribute>

Homozygosity for the C282Y mutation was found in 59 of 65 patients (90.8%); 3 of the patients were compound heterozygotes for the C282Y mutation and the H63D mutation (613609.0002); 1 was homozygous for the H63D mutation; and 2 were heterozygous for H63D. These results corresponded to an allelic frequency of 93.1% for the C282Y and 5.4% for the H63D mutations, respectively. Of note, the C282Y mutation was never observed in the family-based controls, whereas it was present in 5.8% of the general Breton population. This corresponds to a theoretical frequency of about 1 per 1,000 for the disease, which is slightly lower than generally estimated. In contrast, the H63D allelic frequency was nearly the same in both control groups (15% and 16.5% in the family-based and general population controls, respectively). While the experience of Jouanolle et al. (1996) appeared to indicate a close relationship of C282Y to hemochromatosis, the implication of the H63D variant was not clear.</Attribute>

Five patients lacked either mutation, 2 of whom had atypical, early-onset disease.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">Feder et al. (1997) confirmed the prediction that the C282Y mutation would disrupt a critical disulfide bond in the alpha-3 loop of the HFE protein and abrogate binding of the mutant HFE protein to beta-2-microglobulin (B2M; 109700), as well as its transport to and presentation on the cell surface. In vitro, the C282Y mutant HFE protein failed to associate with endogenous B2M in human embryonic kidney cells stably transfected with the mutant cDNA. Waheed et al. (1997) found that whereas the wildtype and H63D HFE proteins associate with beta-2 microglobulin and are expressed on the cell surface of COS-7 cells, these capabilities are lost by the C282Y HFE protein. They presented biochemical and immunofluorescence data indicating that the C282Y mutant protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and middle Golgi compartments, fails to undergo late Golgi processing, and is subject to accelerated degradation. The block in intracellular transport, accelerated turnover, and failure of the C282Y protein to be presented normally on the cell surface provides a possible basis for impaired function of this mutant protein in hereditary hemochromatosis.</Attribute>

(1997) investigated the relationships between the hemochromatosis phenotype and genotypes at the HLA-H locus and surrounding markers. They found that the C282Y substitution is unambiguously associated with the hemochromatosis phenotype; 81.2% of all patients were homozygous. The subgroup of heterozygous individuals showed lower values for serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and iron removed by phlebotomy than did the subgroup of hemochromatosis patients homozygous for C282Y. In the subgroup not homozygous for C282Y, no other mutation in the HLA-H gene was found; hence, the genotype remained unclear. The authors suggested additional nongenetic cause, other mutations, or another gene as explanations for the results in these patients.</Attribute>

The geographic distribution supported the previously suggested Celtic origin of hemochromatosis. In contrast, the H63D substitution is not restricted to European populations. Although absent in the Senegalese, it was found on about 9% of the chromosomes of the central Ethiopians and Algerians genotyped for this study. Thus, the H63D substitution must have occurred earlier than the C282Y substitution.</Attribute>

Cullen et al. (1998) used PCR and restriction-enzyme digestion to analyze the frequency of the C282Y and H63D mutations in HLA-typed samples of non-Caucasian populations, comprising Australian Aboriginal, Chinese, and Pacific Islanders. They found that the C282Y mutation was present in these populations (allele frequency 0.32%), and that it was always seen in conjunction with HLA haplotypes common in Caucasians, suggesting that C282Y may have been introduced into these populations by Caucasian admixture. They found the H63D mutation at an allele frequency of 2.68% in the 2 populations analyzed (Australian Aboriginal and Chinese). In the Australian Aboriginal samples, H63D was found to be associated with HLA haplotypes common in Caucasians, again suggesting that it was introduced by recent admixture. In the Chinese samples analyzed, on the other hand, H63D was present in association with a wide variety of HLA haplotypes, showing that this mutation is widespread and likely to predate the more genetically restricted C282Y mutation.</Attribute>

The most common symptoms of hemochromatosis were no more prevalent among the 152 identified homozygotes than among the controls. The age distribution of homozygotes and compound heterozygotes did not differ significantly from that of controls; there was no measurable loss of such individuals from the population during aging. However, there was a significantly increased prevalence of a history of hepatitis or 'liver trouble' among homozygotes and in the proportion of homozygotes with increased concentrations of serum aspartate aminotransferase and collagen IV; these changes were not related to iron burden or to age. Only 1 of the 152 homozygotes had signs and symptoms that would suggest a diagnosis of hemochromatosis. Beutler et al.

None of the C282Y homozygotes developed clinically overt hemochromatosis.

In a random sample of 1,438 subjects stratified according to HFE genotype, including all 203 C282Y homozygotes (of whom 108 were women and 95 were men), they obtained clinical and biochemical data, including 2 sets of iron measurements performed 12 years apart. Disease related to iron overload was defined as documented iron overload and one or more of the following conditions: cirrhosis, liver fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, elevated aminotransferase levels, physician-diagnosed symptomatic hemochromatosis, and arthropathy of the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints. The proportion of C282Y homozygotes with documented iron overload-related disease was 28.4% for men and 1.2% for women. Only 1 non-C282Y homozygote (a compound heterozygote with his63 to asp) had documented iron overload-related disease. Male C282Y homozygotes with a serum ferritin level of 1,000 micrograms per liter or more were more likely to report fatigue, use of arthritis medicine, and a history of liver disease than were men who had the wildtype gene.

              <Attribute Type="Description">Robson et al. (2004) noted that there is evidence that iron may play a role in the pathology of Alzheimer disease (104300). Thus, genetic factors that contribute to iron deposition resulting in tissue damage might exacerbate AD. The authors examined the interaction between the C2 variant of the TF gene (190000.0004) and the C282Y allele of the HFE gene, the most common basis of hemochromatosis, as risk factors for developing AD. The results showed that each of the 2 variants was associated with an increased risk of AD only in the presence of the other. Neither allele alone had any effect. Carriers of both variants were at 5 times greater risk of AD compared with all others. Furthermore, carriers of these 2 alleles plus APOE4 (see 107741) were at still higher risk of AD: of the 14 carriers of the 3 variants identified in this study, 12 had AD and 2 had mild cognitive impairment. Robson et al. (2004) concluded that their results indicated that the combination of TF*C2 and HFE C282Y may lead to an excess of redoxactive iron and the induction of oxidative stress in neurons, which is exacerbated in carriers of APOE4. They noted that 4% of northern Europeans carry the 2 iron-related variants and that iron overload is a treatable condition.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">In patients with hemochromatosis (HFE1; 235200), Feder et al. (1996) identified an 845G-A transition in the HFE gene (which they referred to as HLA-H or 'cDNA 24'), resulting in a cys282-to-tyr (C282Y) substitution. This missense mutation occurs in a highly conserved residue involved in the intramolecular disulfide bridging of MHC class I proteins, and could therefore disrupt the structure and function of this protein. Using an allele-specific oligonucleotide-ligation assay on their group of 178 patients, they detected the C282Y mutation in 85% of all HFE chromosomes. In contrast, only 10 of the 310 control chromosomes (3.2%) carried the mutation, a carrier frequency of 10/155 = 6.4%. One hundred forty-eight of 178 HH patients were homozygous for this mutation, 9 were heterozygous, and 21 carried only the normal allele. These numbers were extremely discrepant from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The findings corroborated heterogeneity among the hemochromatosis patients, with 83% of cases related to C282Y homozygosity.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">Jazwinska et al. (1996) provided convincing evidence that the C282Y mutation in homozygous form in the HFE gene is the cause of hemochromatosis. In studies in Australia, patients properly characterized at the genotypic and phenotypic level all showed homozygosity for the C282Y substitution. Irrespective of haplotype, all HH heterozygotes were cys/tyr heterozygotes, and all homozygous normal controls were cys/cys homozygotes. The presence of a single mutation in all patients contrasted with the data of Feder et al. (1996), who reported a lower frequency of the mutation. Jazwinska et al. (1996) suggested that different clinical criteria for the diagnosis of HH may account for the difference, or that HH may not be as homogeneous as previously believed. They noted that a key question is why there is a variation in severity of iron loading in HH that is haplotype-related when the mutation is identical in all haplotypes tested. Jazwinska et al. (1996) hypothesized that the HFE locus is the primary HH locus, but that there are likely to be other 6p-linked modifying genes that would explain both the HLA-linked haplotype variation in expression of the disorder and the large region of linkage disequilibrium present in all populations and spanning at least 4.5 Mb distal of D6S265.</Attribute>

(1996) commented on the significance of the C282Y mutation on the basis of a group of 65 unrelated affected individuals who had been under study in France for more than 10 years and identified by stringent criteria. Homozygosity for the C282Y mutation was found in 59 of 65 patients (90.8%); 3 of the patients were compound heterozygotes for the C282Y mutation and the H63D mutation (613609.0002); 1 was homozygous for the H63D mutation; and 2 were heterozygous for H63D. These results corresponded to an allelic frequency of 93.1% for the C282Y and 5.4% for the H63D mutations, respectively. Of note, the C282Y mutation was never observed in the family-based controls, whereas it was present in 5.8% of the general Breton population. This corresponds to a theoretical frequency of about 1 per 1,000 for the disease, which is slightly lower than generally estimated. In contrast, the H63D allelic frequency was nearly the same in both control groups (15% and 16.5% in the family-based and general population controls, respectively). While the experience of Jouanolle et al. (1996) appeared to indicate a close relationship of C282Y to hemochromatosis, the implication of the H63D variant was not clear.</Attribute>

One of 101 controls was also found to be homozygous but was subsequently found to have evidence of iron overload. Compound heterozygosity for the C282Y and H63D mutations was found in 3 patients who had mild disease and in 4 controls who had no signs of iron overload.

              <Attribute Type="Description">Feder et al. (1997) confirmed the prediction that the C282Y mutation would disrupt a critical disulfide bond in the alpha-3 loop of the HFE protein and abrogate binding of the mutant HFE protein to beta-2-microglobulin (B2M; 109700), as well as its transport to and presentation on the cell surface. In vitro, the C282Y mutant HFE protein failed to associate with endogenous B2M in human embryonic kidney cells stably transfected with the mutant cDNA. Waheed et al. (1997) found that whereas the wildtype and H63D HFE proteins associate with beta-2 microglobulin and are expressed on the cell surface of COS-7 cells, these capabilities are lost by the C282Y HFE protein. They presented biochemical and immunofluorescence data indicating that the C282Y mutant protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and middle Golgi compartments, fails to undergo late Golgi processing, and is subject to accelerated degradation. The block in intracellular transport, accelerated turnover, and failure of the C282Y protein to be presented normally on the cell surface provides a possible basis for impaired function of this mutant protein in hereditary hemochromatosis.</Attribute>

(1997) investigated the relationships between the hemochromatosis phenotype and genotypes at the HLA-H locus and surrounding markers. They found that the C282Y substitution is unambiguously associated with the hemochromatosis phenotype; 81.2% of all patients were homozygous. The subgroup of heterozygous individuals showed lower values for serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and iron removed by phlebotomy than did the subgroup of hemochromatosis patients homozygous for C282Y. In the subgroup not homozygous for C282Y, no other mutation in the HLA-H gene was found; hence, the genotype remained unclear. The authors suggested additional nongenetic cause, other mutations, or another gene as explanations for the results in these patients.</Attribute>

Cullen et al.

They found that the C282Y mutation was present in these populations (allele frequency 0.32%), and that it was always seen in conjunction with HLA haplotypes common in Caucasians, suggesting that C282Y may have been introduced into these populations by Caucasian admixture. They found the H63D mutation at an allele frequency of 2.68% in the 2 populations analyzed (Australian Aboriginal and Chinese). In the Australian Aboriginal samples, H63D was found to be associated with HLA haplotypes common in Caucasians, again suggesting that it was introduced by recent admixture. In the Chinese samples analyzed, on the other hand, H63D was present in association with a wide variety of HLA haplotypes, showing that this mutation is widespread and likely to predate the more genetically restricted C282Y mutation.</Attribute>

The most common symptoms of hemochromatosis were no more prevalent among the 152 identified homozygotes than among the controls. The age distribution of homozygotes and compound heterozygotes did not differ significantly from that of controls; there was no measurable loss of such individuals from the population during aging. However, there was a significantly increased prevalence of a history of hepatitis or 'liver trouble' among homozygotes and in the proportion of homozygotes with increased concentrations of serum aspartate aminotransferase and collagen IV; these changes were not related to iron burden or to age. Only 1 of the 152 homozygotes had signs and symptoms that would suggest a diagnosis of hemochromatosis. Beutler et al.

The frequency of the 16189 variant was found to be elevated in individuals with hemochromatosis who were homozygous for the C282Y allele, compared with population controls and with C282Y homozygotes who were asymptomatic.

(2008) reported on a study of HFE mutations in 31,192 persons of northern European descent between ages 40 and 69 years who participated in the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study and were followed for an average of 12 years. In a random sample of 1,438 subjects stratified according to HFE genotype, including all 203 C282Y homozygotes (of whom 108 were women and 95 were men), they obtained clinical and biochemical data, including 2 sets of iron measurements performed 12 years apart. Disease related to iron overload was defined as documented iron overload and one or more of the following conditions: cirrhosis, liver fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, elevated aminotransferase levels, physician-diagnosed symptomatic hemochromatosis, and arthropathy of the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints. The proportion of C282Y homozygotes with documented iron overload-related disease was 28.4% for men and 1.2% for women. Only 1 non-C282Y homozygote (a compound heterozygote with his63 to asp) had documented iron overload-related disease. Male C282Y homozygotes with a serum ferritin level of 1,000 micrograms per liter or more were more likely to report fatigue, use of arthritis medicine, and a history of liver disease than were men who had the wildtype gene. Waalen and Beutler (2008) and Rienhoff (2008) commented that the study by Allen et al. (2008) may have overestimated the clinical prevalence and penetrance of iron-overload disease in C282Y homozygotes.</Attribute>

The first mutation deleted a large portion of the coding sequence, generating a null allele. The second mutation introduced the C282Y change into the Hfe gene but otherwise left the gene intact. Homozygosity for either mutation resulted in postnatal iron loading. The effects of the null mutation were more severe than the effects of the C282Y mutation. The mice heterozygous for either mutation accumulated more iron than normal controls. Although liver iron stores were greatly increased, splenic iron was decreased. Levy et al.

Thus, genetic factors that contribute to iron deposition resulting in tissue damage might exacerbate AD. The authors examined the interaction between the C2 variant of the TF gene (190000.0004) and the C282Y allele of the HFE gene, the most common basis of hemochromatosis, as risk factors for developing AD. The results showed that each of the 2 variants was associated with an increased risk of AD only in the presence of the other. Neither allele alone had any effect. Carriers of both variants were at 5 times greater risk of AD compared with all others. Furthermore, carriers of these 2 alleles plus APOE4 (see 107741) were at still higher risk of AD: of the 14 carriers of the 3 variants identified in this study, 12 had AD and 2 had mild cognitive impairment. Robson et al. (2004) concluded that their results indicated that the combination of TF*C2 and HFE C282Y may lead to an excess of redoxactive iron and the induction of oxidative stress in neurons, which is exacerbated in carriers of APOE4. They noted that 4% of northern Europeans carry the 2 iron-related variants and that iron overload is a treatable condition.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">In patients with hemochromatosis (HFE1; 235200), Feder et al. (1996) identified an 845G-A transition in the HFE gene (which they referred to as HLA-H or 'cDNA 24'), resulting in a cys282-to-tyr (C282Y) substitution. This missense mutation occurs in a highly conserved residue involved in the intramolecular disulfide bridging of MHC class I proteins, and could therefore disrupt the structure and function of this protein. Using an allele-specific oligonucleotide-ligation assay on their group of 178 patients, they detected the C282Y mutation in 85% of all HFE chromosomes. In contrast, only 10 of the 310 control chromosomes (3.2%) carried the mutation, a carrier frequency of 10/155 = 6.4%. One hundred forty-eight of 178 HH patients were homozygous for this mutation, 9 were heterozygous, and 21 carried only the normal allele. These numbers were extremely discrepant from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The findings corroborated heterogeneity among the hemochromatosis patients, with 83% of cases related to C282Y homozygosity.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">Jazwinska et al. (1996) provided convincing evidence that the C282Y mutation in homozygous form in the HFE gene is the cause of hemochromatosis. In studies in Australia, patients properly characterized at the genotypic and phenotypic level all showed homozygosity for the C282Y substitution. Irrespective of haplotype, all HH heterozygotes were cys/tyr heterozygotes, and all homozygous normal controls were cys/cys homozygotes. The presence of a single mutation in all patients contrasted with the data of Feder et al. (1996), who reported a lower frequency of the mutation. Jazwinska et al. (1996) suggested that different clinical criteria for the diagnosis of HH may account for the difference, or that HH may not be as homogeneous as previously believed. They noted that a key question is why there is a variation in severity of iron loading in HH that is haplotype-related when the mutation is identical in all haplotypes tested. Jazwinska et al. (1996) hypothesized that the HFE locus is the primary HH locus, but that there are likely to be other 6p-linked modifying genes that would explain both the HLA-linked haplotype variation in expression of the disorder and the large region of linkage disequilibrium present in all populations and spanning at least 4.5 Mb distal of D6S265.</Attribute>

Homozygosity for the C282Y mutation was found in 59 of 65 patients (90.8%); 3 of the patients were compound heterozygotes for the C282Y mutation and the H63D mutation (613609.0002); 1 was homozygous for the H63D mutation; and 2 were heterozygous for H63D. These results corresponded to an allelic frequency of 93.1% for the C282Y and 5.4% for the H63D mutations, respectively. Of note, the C282Y mutation was never observed in the family-based controls, whereas it was present in 5.8% of the general Breton population. This corresponds to a theoretical frequency of about 1 per 1,000 for the disease, which is slightly lower than generally estimated. In contrast, the H63D allelic frequency was nearly the same in both control groups (15% and 16.5% in the family-based and general population controls, respectively). While the experience of Jouanolle et al. (1996) appeared to indicate a close relationship of C282Y to hemochromatosis, the implication of the H63D variant was not clear.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">Among 132 unrelated hemochromatosis patients in Brittany, Jouanolle et al. (1997) found that 92% were homozygous for the C282Y mutation and that all 264 chromosomes except 5 carried either the C282Y mutation or the H63D mutation. The UK Haemochromatosis Consortium (1997) genotyped 115 unrelated hereditary hemochromatosis patients and found that 105 (91%) were homozygous for the C282Y mutation. One of 101 controls was also found to be homozygous but was subsequently found to have evidence of iron overload. Compound heterozygosity for the C282Y and H63D mutations was found in 3 patients who had mild disease and in 4 controls who had no signs of iron overload. Five patients lacked either mutation, 2 of whom had atypical, early-onset disease.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">Feder et al. (1997) confirmed the prediction that the C282Y mutation would disrupt a critical disulfide bond in the alpha-3 loop of the HFE protein and abrogate binding of the mutant HFE protein to beta-2-microglobulin (B2M; 109700), as well as its transport to and presentation on the cell surface. In vitro, the C282Y mutant HFE protein failed to associate with endogenous B2M in human embryonic kidney cells stably transfected with the mutant cDNA. Waheed et al. (1997) found that whereas the wildtype and H63D HFE proteins associate with beta-2 microglobulin and are expressed on the cell surface of COS-7 cells, these capabilities are lost by the C282Y HFE protein. They presented biochemical and immunofluorescence data indicating that the C282Y mutant protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and middle Golgi compartments, fails to undergo late Golgi processing, and is subject to accelerated degradation. The block in intracellular transport, accelerated turnover, and failure of the C282Y protein to be presented normally on the cell surface provides a possible basis for impaired function of this mutant protein in hereditary hemochromatosis.</Attribute>

(1997) investigated the relationships between the hemochromatosis phenotype and genotypes at the HLA-H locus and surrounding markers. They found that the C282Y substitution is unambiguously associated with the hemochromatosis phenotype; 81.2% of all patients were homozygous. The subgroup of heterozygous individuals showed lower values for serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and iron removed by phlebotomy than did the subgroup of hemochromatosis patients homozygous for C282Y. In the subgroup not homozygous for C282Y, no other mutation in the HLA-H gene was found; hence, the genotype remained unclear. The authors suggested additional nongenetic cause, other mutations, or another gene as explanations for the results in these patients.</Attribute>

The geographic distribution supported the previously suggested Celtic origin of hemochromatosis. In contrast, the H63D substitution is not restricted to European populations. Although absent in the Senegalese, it was found on about 9% of the chromosomes of the central Ethiopians and Algerians genotyped for this study. Thus, the H63D substitution must have occurred earlier than the C282Y substitution.</Attribute>

Cullen et al. (1998) used PCR and restriction-enzyme digestion to analyze the frequency of the C282Y and H63D mutations in HLA-typed samples of non-Caucasian populations, comprising Australian Aboriginal, Chinese, and Pacific Islanders. They found that the C282Y mutation was present in these populations (allele frequency 0.32%), and that it was always seen in conjunction with HLA haplotypes common in Caucasians, suggesting that C282Y may have been introduced into these populations by Caucasian admixture. They found the H63D mutation at an allele frequency of 2.68% in the 2 populations analyzed (Australian Aboriginal and Chinese). In the Australian Aboriginal samples, H63D was found to be associated with HLA haplotypes common in Caucasians, again suggesting that it was introduced by recent admixture. In the Chinese samples analyzed, on the other hand, H63D was present in association with a wide variety of HLA haplotypes, showing that this mutation is widespread and likely to predate the more genetically restricted C282Y mutation.</Attribute>

The most common symptoms of hemochromatosis were no more prevalent among the 152 identified homozygotes than among the controls. The age distribution of homozygotes and compound heterozygotes did not differ significantly from that of controls; there was no measurable loss of such individuals from the population during aging. However, there was a significantly increased prevalence of a history of hepatitis or 'liver trouble' among homozygotes and in the proportion of homozygotes with increased concentrations of serum aspartate aminotransferase and collagen IV; these changes were not related to iron burden or to age. Only 1 of the 152 homozygotes had signs and symptoms that would suggest a diagnosis of hemochromatosis. Beutler et al.

None of the C282Y homozygotes developed clinically overt hemochromatosis.

In a random sample of 1,438 subjects stratified according to HFE genotype, including all 203 C282Y homozygotes (of whom 108 were women and 95 were men), they obtained clinical and biochemical data, including 2 sets of iron measurements performed 12 years apart. Disease related to iron overload was defined as documented iron overload and one or more of the following conditions: cirrhosis, liver fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, elevated aminotransferase levels, physician-diagnosed symptomatic hemochromatosis, and arthropathy of the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints. The proportion of C282Y homozygotes with documented iron overload-related disease was 28.4% for men and 1.2% for women. Only 1 non-C282Y homozygote (a compound heterozygote with his63 to asp) had documented iron overload-related disease. Male C282Y homozygotes with a serum ferritin level of 1,000 micrograms per liter or more were more likely to report fatigue, use of arthritis medicine, and a history of liver disease than were men who had the wildtype gene.

              <Attribute Type="Description">Robson et al. (2004) noted that there is evidence that iron may play a role in the pathology of Alzheimer disease (104300). Thus, genetic factors that contribute to iron deposition resulting in tissue damage might exacerbate AD. The authors examined the interaction between the C2 variant of the TF gene (190000.0004) and the C282Y allele of the HFE gene, the most common basis of hemochromatosis, as risk factors for developing AD. The results showed that each of the 2 variants was associated with an increased risk of AD only in the presence of the other. Neither allele alone had any effect. Carriers of both variants were at 5 times greater risk of AD compared with all others. Furthermore, carriers of these 2 alleles plus APOE4 (see 107741) were at still higher risk of AD: of the 14 carriers of the 3 variants identified in this study, 12 had AD and 2 had mild cognitive impairment. Robson et al. (2004) concluded that their results indicated that the combination of TF*C2 and HFE C282Y may lead to an excess of redoxactive iron and the induction of oxidative stress in neurons, which is exacerbated in carriers of APOE4. They noted that 4% of northern Europeans carry the 2 iron-related variants and that iron overload is a treatable condition.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">In patients with hemochromatosis (HFE1; 235200), Feder et al. (1996) identified an 845G-A transition in the HFE gene (which they referred to as HLA-H or 'cDNA 24'), resulting in a cys282-to-tyr (C282Y) substitution. This missense mutation occurs in a highly conserved residue involved in the intramolecular disulfide bridging of MHC class I proteins, and could therefore disrupt the structure and function of this protein. Using an allele-specific oligonucleotide-ligation assay on their group of 178 patients, they detected the C282Y mutation in 85% of all HFE chromosomes. In contrast, only 10 of the 310 control chromosomes (3.2%) carried the mutation, a carrier frequency of 10/155 = 6.4%. One hundred forty-eight of 178 HH patients were homozygous for this mutation, 9 were heterozygous, and 21 carried only the normal allele. These numbers were extremely discrepant from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The findings corroborated heterogeneity among the hemochromatosis patients, with 83% of cases related to C282Y homozygosity.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">Jazwinska et al. (1996) provided convincing evidence that the C282Y mutation in homozygous form in the HFE gene is the cause of hemochromatosis. In studies in Australia, patients properly characterized at the genotypic and phenotypic level all showed homozygosity for the C282Y substitution. Irrespective of haplotype, all HH heterozygotes were cys/tyr heterozygotes, and all homozygous normal controls were cys/cys homozygotes. The presence of a single mutation in all patients contrasted with the data of Feder et al. (1996), who reported a lower frequency of the mutation. Jazwinska et al. (1996) suggested that different clinical criteria for the diagnosis of HH may account for the difference, or that HH may not be as homogeneous as previously believed. They noted that a key question is why there is a variation in severity of iron loading in HH that is haplotype-related when the mutation is identical in all haplotypes tested. Jazwinska et al. (1996) hypothesized that the HFE locus is the primary HH locus, but that there are likely to be other 6p-linked modifying genes that would explain both the HLA-linked haplotype variation in expression of the disorder and the large region of linkage disequilibrium present in all populations and spanning at least 4.5 Mb distal of D6S265.</Attribute>

(1996) commented on the significance of the C282Y mutation on the basis of a group of 65 unrelated affected individuals who had been under study in France for more than 10 years and identified by stringent criteria. Homozygosity for the C282Y mutation was found in 59 of 65 patients (90.8%); 3 of the patients were compound heterozygotes for the C282Y mutation and the H63D mutation (613609.0002); 1 was homozygous for the H63D mutation; and 2 were heterozygous for H63D. These results corresponded to an allelic frequency of 93.1% for the C282Y and 5.4% for the H63D mutations, respectively. Of note, the C282Y mutation was never observed in the family-based controls, whereas it was present in 5.8% of the general Breton population. This corresponds to a theoretical frequency of about 1 per 1,000 for the disease, which is slightly lower than generally estimated. In contrast, the H63D allelic frequency was nearly the same in both control groups (15% and 16.5% in the family-based and general population controls, respectively). While the experience of Jouanolle et al. (1996) appeared to indicate a close relationship of C282Y to hemochromatosis, the implication of the H63D variant was not clear.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">Feder et al. (1997) confirmed the prediction that the C282Y mutation would disrupt a critical disulfide bond in the alpha-3 loop of the HFE protein and abrogate binding of the mutant HFE protein to beta-2-microglobulin (B2M; 109700), as well as its transport to and presentation on the cell surface. In vitro, the C282Y mutant HFE protein failed to associate with endogenous B2M in human embryonic kidney cells stably transfected with the mutant cDNA. Waheed et al. (1997) found that whereas the wildtype and H63D HFE proteins associate with beta-2 microglobulin and are expressed on the cell surface of COS-7 cells, these capabilities are lost by the C282Y HFE protein. They presented biochemical and immunofluorescence data indicating that the C282Y mutant protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and middle Golgi compartments, fails to undergo late Golgi processing, and is subject to accelerated degradation. The block in intracellular transport, accelerated turnover, and failure of the C282Y protein to be presented normally on the cell surface provides a possible basis for impaired function of this mutant protein in hereditary hemochromatosis.</Attribute>

(1997) investigated the relationships between the hemochromatosis phenotype and genotypes at the HLA-H locus and surrounding markers. They found that the C282Y substitution is unambiguously associated with the hemochromatosis phenotype; 81.2% of all patients were homozygous. The subgroup of heterozygous individuals showed lower values for serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and iron removed by phlebotomy than did the subgroup of hemochromatosis patients homozygous for C282Y. In the subgroup not homozygous for C282Y, no other mutation in the HLA-H gene was found; hence, the genotype remained unclear. The authors suggested additional nongenetic cause, other mutations, or another gene as explanations for the results in these patients.</Attribute>

Cullen et al.

They found that the C282Y mutation was present in these populations (allele frequency 0.32%), and that it was always seen in conjunction with HLA haplotypes common in Caucasians, suggesting that C282Y may have been introduced into these populations by Caucasian admixture. They found the H63D mutation at an allele frequency of 2.68% in the 2 populations analyzed (Australian Aboriginal and Chinese). In the Australian Aboriginal samples, H63D was found to be associated with HLA haplotypes common in Caucasians, again suggesting that it was introduced by recent admixture. In the Chinese samples analyzed, on the other hand, H63D was present in association with a wide variety of HLA haplotypes, showing that this mutation is widespread and likely to predate the more genetically restricted C282Y mutation.</Attribute>

The most common symptoms of hemochromatosis were no more prevalent among the 152 identified homozygotes than among the controls. The age distribution of homozygotes and compound heterozygotes did not differ significantly from that of controls; there was no measurable loss of such individuals from the population during aging. However, there was a significantly increased prevalence of a history of hepatitis or 'liver trouble' among homozygotes and in the proportion of homozygotes with increased concentrations of serum aspartate aminotransferase and collagen IV; these changes were not related to iron burden or to age. Only 1 of the 152 homozygotes had signs and symptoms that would suggest a diagnosis of hemochromatosis. Beutler et al.

              <Attribute Type="Description">Andersen et al. (2004) undertook to determine the progression rate of iron overload in hereditary hemochromatosis in individuals in the general population, and to answer the question of how frequently asymptomatic C282Y homozygotes identified in the population need to be screened for manifestations of hemochromatosis in later years. As a function of biologic age, transferrin saturation and ferritin levels increase slightly in male and female C282Y homozygotes. None of the C282Y homozygotes developed clinically overt hemochromatosis. The authors concluded that most such homozygotes need to be screened for manifestation of hemochromatosis every 10 to 20 years.</Attribute>

(2008) reported on a study of HFE mutations in 31,192 persons of northern European descent between ages 40 and 69 years who participated in the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study and were followed for an average of 12 years. In a random sample of 1,438 subjects stratified according to HFE genotype, including all 203 C282Y homozygotes (of whom 108 were women and 95 were men), they obtained clinical and biochemical data, including 2 sets of iron measurements performed 12 years apart. Disease related to iron overload was defined as documented iron overload and one or more of the following conditions: cirrhosis, liver fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, elevated aminotransferase levels, physician-diagnosed symptomatic hemochromatosis, and arthropathy of the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints. The proportion of C282Y homozygotes with documented iron overload-related disease was 28.4% for men and 1.2% for women. Only 1 non-C282Y homozygote (a compound heterozygote with his63 to asp) had documented iron overload-related disease. Male C282Y homozygotes with a serum ferritin level of 1,000 micrograms per liter or more were more likely to report fatigue, use of arthritis medicine, and a history of liver disease than were men who had the wildtype gene. Waalen and Beutler (2008) and Rienhoff (2008) commented that the study by Allen et al.

The first mutation deleted a large portion of the coding sequence, generating a null allele. The second mutation introduced the C282Y change into the Hfe gene but otherwise left the gene intact. Homozygosity for either mutation resulted in postnatal iron loading. The effects of the null mutation were more severe than the effects of the C282Y mutation. The mice heterozygous for either mutation accumulated more iron than normal controls. Although liver iron stores were greatly increased, splenic iron was decreased. Levy et al.

Thus, genetic factors that contribute to iron deposition resulting in tissue damage might exacerbate AD. The authors examined the interaction between the C2 variant of the TF gene (190000.0004) and the C282Y allele of the HFE gene, the most common basis of hemochromatosis, as risk factors for developing AD. The results showed that each of the 2 variants was associated with an increased risk of AD only in the presence of the other. Neither allele alone had any effect. Carriers of both variants were at 5 times greater risk of AD compared with all others. Furthermore, carriers of these 2 alleles plus APOE4 (see 107741) were at still higher risk of AD: of the 14 carriers of the 3 variants identified in this study, 12 had AD and 2 had mild cognitive impairment. Robson et al. (2004) concluded that their results indicated that the combination of TF*C2 and HFE C282Y may lead to an excess of redoxactive iron and the induction of oxidative stress in neurons, which is exacerbated in carriers of APOE4. They noted that 4% of northern Europeans carry the 2 iron-related variants and that iron overload is a treatable condition.</Attribute>

(1996) identified an 845G-A transition in the HFE gene (which they referred to as HLA-H or 'cDNA 24'), resulting in a cys282-to-tyr (C282Y) substitution. This missense mutation occurs in a highly conserved residue involved in the intramolecular disulfide bridging of MHC class I proteins, and could therefore disrupt the structure and function of this protein. Using an allele-specific oligonucleotide-ligation assay on their group of 178 patients, they detected the C282Y mutation in 85% of all HFE chromosomes. In contrast, only 10 of the 310 control chromosomes (3.2%) carried the mutation, a carrier frequency of 10/155 = 6.4%. One hundred forty-eight of 178 HH patients were homozygous for this mutation, 9 were heterozygous, and 21 carried only the normal allele. These numbers were extremely discrepant from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The findings corroborated heterogeneity among the hemochromatosis patients, with 83% of cases related to C282Y homozygosity.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">Jazwinska et al. (1996) provided convincing evidence that the C282Y mutation in homozygous form in the HFE gene is the cause of hemochromatosis. In studies in Australia, patients properly characterized at the genotypic and phenotypic level all showed homozygosity for the C282Y substitution. Irrespective of haplotype, all HH heterozygotes were cys/tyr heterozygotes, and all homozygous normal controls were cys/cys homozygotes. The presence of a single mutation in all patients contrasted with the data of Feder et al. (1996), who reported a lower frequency of the mutation. Jazwinska et al. (1996) suggested that different clinical criteria for the diagnosis of HH may account for the difference, or that HH may not be as homogeneous as previously believed. They noted that a key question is why there is a variation in severity of iron loading in HH that is haplotype-related when the mutation is identical in all haplotypes tested. Jazwinska et al. (1996) hypothesized that the HFE locus is the primary HH locus, but that there are likely to be other 6p-linked modifying genes that would explain both the HLA-linked haplotype variation in expression of the disorder and the large region of linkage disequilibrium present in all populations and spanning at least 4.5 Mb distal of D6S265.</Attribute>

Homozygosity for the C282Y mutation was found in 59 of 65 patients (90.8%); 3 of the patients were compound heterozygotes for the C282Y mutation and the H63D mutation (613609.0002); 1 was homozygous for the H63D mutation; and 2 were heterozygous for H63D. These results corresponded to an allelic frequency of 93.1% for the C282Y and 5.4% for the H63D mutations, respectively. Of note, the C282Y mutation was never observed in the family-based controls, whereas it was present in 5.8% of the general Breton population. This corresponds to a theoretical frequency of about 1 per 1,000 for the disease, which is slightly lower than generally estimated. In contrast, the H63D allelic frequency was nearly the same in both control groups (15% and 16.5% in the family-based and general population controls, respectively). While the experience of Jouanolle et al. (1996) appeared to indicate a close relationship of C282Y to hemochromatosis, the implication of the H63D variant was not clear.</Attribute>

All of the C282Y homozygous patients were also homozygous for the wildtype nucleotide 187C (see H63D; 613609.0002), and all C282Y heterozygotes had at least 1 copy of 187C. Thus, the 2 nucleotides, 845 and 187, were in complete linkage disequilibrium; nucleotide 187 was a C on all chromosomes with the 845A (C282Y) mutation.

(1997) found that 92% were homozygous for the C282Y mutation and that all 264 chromosomes except 5 carried either the C282Y mutation or the H63D mutation. The UK Haemochromatosis Consortium (1997) genotyped 115 unrelated hereditary hemochromatosis patients and found that 105 (91%) were homozygous for the C282Y mutation. One of 101 controls was also found to be homozygous but was subsequently found to have evidence of iron overload. Compound heterozygosity for the C282Y and H63D mutations was found in 3 patients who had mild disease and in 4 controls who had no signs of iron overload. Five patients lacked either mutation, 2 of whom had atypical, early-onset disease.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">Feder et al. (1997) confirmed the prediction that the C282Y mutation would disrupt a critical disulfide bond in the alpha-3 loop of the HFE protein and abrogate binding of the mutant HFE protein to beta-2-microglobulin (B2M; 109700), as well as its transport to and presentation on the cell surface. In vitro, the C282Y mutant HFE protein failed to associate with endogenous B2M in human embryonic kidney cells stably transfected with the mutant cDNA. Waheed et al. (1997) found that whereas the wildtype and H63D HFE proteins associate with beta-2 microglobulin and are expressed on the cell surface of COS-7 cells, these capabilities are lost by the C282Y HFE protein. They presented biochemical and immunofluorescence data indicating that the C282Y mutant protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and middle Golgi compartments, fails to undergo late Golgi processing, and is subject to accelerated degradation. The block in intracellular transport, accelerated turnover, and failure of the C282Y protein to be presented normally on the cell surface provides a possible basis for impaired function of this mutant protein in hereditary hemochromatosis.</Attribute>

(1997) investigated the relationships between the hemochromatosis phenotype and genotypes at the HLA-H locus and surrounding markers. They found that the C282Y substitution is unambiguously associated with the hemochromatosis phenotype; 81.2% of all patients were homozygous. The subgroup of heterozygous individuals showed lower values for serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and iron removed by phlebotomy than did the subgroup of hemochromatosis patients homozygous for C282Y. In the subgroup not homozygous for C282Y, no other mutation in the HLA-H gene was found; hence, the genotype remained unclear. The authors suggested additional nongenetic cause, other mutations, or another gene as explanations for the results in these patients.</Attribute>

Although absent in the Senegalese, it was found on about 9% of the chromosomes of the central Ethiopians and Algerians genotyped for this study.

Cullen et al. (1998) used PCR and restriction-enzyme digestion to analyze the frequency of the C282Y and H63D mutations in HLA-typed samples of non-Caucasian populations, comprising Australian Aboriginal, Chinese, and Pacific Islanders. They found that the C282Y mutation was present in these populations (allele frequency 0.32%), and that it was always seen in conjunction with HLA haplotypes common in Caucasians, suggesting that C282Y may have been introduced into these populations by Caucasian admixture. They found the H63D mutation at an allele frequency of 2.68% in the 2 populations analyzed (Australian Aboriginal and Chinese). In the Australian Aboriginal samples, H63D was found to be associated with HLA haplotypes common in Caucasians, again suggesting that it was introduced by recent admixture. In the Chinese samples analyzed, on the other hand, H63D was present in association with a wide variety of HLA haplotypes, showing that this mutation is widespread and likely to predate the more genetically restricted C282Y mutation.</Attribute>

The most common symptoms of hemochromatosis were no more prevalent among the 152 identified homozygotes than among the controls. The age distribution of homozygotes and compound heterozygotes did not differ significantly from that of controls; there was no measurable loss of such individuals from the population during aging. However, there was a significantly increased prevalence of a history of hepatitis or 'liver trouble' among homozygotes and in the proportion of homozygotes with increased concentrations of serum aspartate aminotransferase and collagen IV; these changes were not related to iron burden or to age. Only 1 of the 152 homozygotes had signs and symptoms that would suggest a diagnosis of hemochromatosis. Beutler et al.

In a random sample of 1,438 subjects stratified according to HFE genotype, including all 203 C282Y homozygotes (of whom 108 were women and 95 were men), they obtained clinical and biochemical data, including 2 sets of iron measurements performed 12 years apart. Disease related to iron overload was defined as documented iron overload and one or more of the following conditions: cirrhosis, liver fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, elevated aminotransferase levels, physician-diagnosed symptomatic hemochromatosis, and arthropathy of the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints. The proportion of C282Y homozygotes with documented iron overload-related disease was 28.4% for men and 1.2% for women. Only 1 non-C282Y homozygote (a compound heterozygote with his63 to asp) had documented iron overload-related disease. Male C282Y homozygotes with a serum ferritin level of 1,000 micrograms per liter or more were more likely to report fatigue, use of arthritis medicine, and a history of liver disease than were men who had the wildtype gene.

              <Attribute Type="Description">Oliva et al. (2004) analyzed the C282Y HFE polymorphism in 225 Spanish patients with type 2 diabetes and detected a younger age of onset and longer duration of disease in patients carrying at least 1 C282Y allele. They also found an increased prevalence of retinopathy (p = 0.014) and of nephropathy (p = 0.04) in individuals carrying at least 1 C282Y allele; the increased prevalence of retinopathy, but not nephropathy, in C282Y carriers was related to increased duration of disease. Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed that the prevalence of nephropathy was higher in the group of patients carrying at least 1 Y allele.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">Robson et al. (2004) noted that there is evidence that iron may play a role in the pathology of Alzheimer disease (104300). Thus, genetic factors that contribute to iron deposition resulting in tissue damage might exacerbate AD. The authors examined the interaction between the C2 variant of the TF gene (190000.0004) and the C282Y allele of the HFE gene, the most common basis of hemochromatosis, as risk factors for developing AD. The results showed that each of the 2 variants was associated with an increased risk of AD only in the presence of the other. Neither allele alone had any effect. Carriers of both variants were at 5 times greater risk of AD compared with all others. Furthermore, carriers of these 2 alleles plus APOE4 (see 107741) were at still higher risk of AD: of the 14 carriers of the 3 variants identified in this study, 12 had AD and 2 had mild cognitive impairment. Robson et al. (2004) concluded that their results indicated that the combination of TF*C2 and HFE C282Y may lead to an excess of redoxactive iron and the induction of oxidative stress in neurons, which is exacerbated in carriers of APOE4. They noted that 4% of northern Europeans carry the 2 iron-related variants and that iron overload is a treatable condition.</Attribute>

          <Comment Type="public">The C282Y variant in the HFE gene is the most common pathogenic variant associated with hereditary hemochromatosis (Cezard et al., 2014; Feder et al., 1996). The C282Y variant is observed in 7,275/126,464 (5.7%%) alleles from individuals of non-Finnish European background in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). The C282Y variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. Functional studies have shown that the C282Y results in a protein that does not reach the cell surface and is subject to accelerated degradation (Waheed et al., 1997). We interpret C282Y as a pathogenic variant.</Comment>

          <Comment>This sequence change replaces cysteine with tyrosine at codon 282 of the HFE protein (p.Cys282Tyr). The cysteine residue is highly conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between cysteine and tyrosine. This variant is present in population databases (rs1800562, ExAC 5%). This is a common, low penetrance variant that is known to contribute to hemochromatosis when homozygous or present with a second pathogenic allele in HFE. As many as 90% of individuals of European descent who are affected with hemochromatosis are homozygous for this variant (PMID: 16132052, 26153218, 26365338). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 9). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change disrupts a disulfide bond in the Å’Â±3 domain of the HFE protein and impairs interaction of HFE with beta2-microglobulin, resulting in a block in intracellular transport and loss of cell surface expression of the Cys282Tyr variant protein (PMID: 9162021, 9356458). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic (low penetrance).</Comment>

          <Comment>The p.Cys282Tyr variant in HFE is a well-established pathogenic variant for here ditary hemochromatosis (HH). Although it is considered pathogenic, the penetranc e is significantly reduced. Biochemically, 82% of p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes and 17 % of p.Cys282Tyr/p.His63Asp compound heterozygotes were shown to have elevated t ransferrin saturation (Pederson 2009); however, less than 5% of individuals with biallelic pathogenic HFE variants exhibit clinical symptoms of HH (Beutler 2002 , Gurrin 2009). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as path ogenic for HH in an autosomal recessive pattern but with significantly reduced p enetrance. ACMG/AMP Criteria applied: PS3; PS4; PM3.</Comment>

          <Comment Type="public">The c.845G&gt;A (p.Cys282Tyr) missense variant is widely recognized as one of the two most common disease-causing variants in the HFE gene. Cys282Tyr homozygotes account for 80-85% of typical patients with Hereditary Hemochromatosis (HH). However, the majority of individuals who are homozygous for this variant do not develop the disease (GeneReviews, Kowdley et al., 2012; Ramrakhiani and Bacon, 1998; and Morrison et al., 2003). In summary, this variant c.845G&gt;A (p.Cys282Tyr) meets our criteria for a Pathogenic classification. We have confirmed this finding in our laboratory using Sanger sequencing.</Comment>

          <Comment Type="public">The c.845G&gt;A (p.Cys282Tyr) variant in the HFE gene in the homozygous state has been reported as a common cause of hereditary hemochromatosis with high penetrance of biochemically defined iron overload but low penetrance of clinically defined iron overload [OMIM:613609.0001; PMID 8896549, 10381492, 18199861]. This variant has been detected at high frequency in the ExAC population database (up to 5% in Europeans) (http://exac.broadinstitute.org/variant/6-26093141-G-A). Cysteine at amino acid position 282 of the HFE protein is highly conserved in mammals and computer-based algorithms predict this p.Cys282Tyr change to be deleterious. This variant is classified as pathogenic.&lt;BR&gt;Apparent homozygosity of this variant may be caused by the presence of the mutant allele on both alleles of this individual, or the presence of a mutant allele on one allele and an exonic deletion on the opposite allele. Copy number variant (CNV) analysis or segregation analysis is necessary to assess the apparent homozygosity status of this variant.</Comment>

          <Comment Type="public">The HFE c.845G&gt;A (p.Cys282Tyr) missense variant is one of the two most common and well-studied pathogenic variants associated with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), with approximately 80-87% of HH type 1 patients of European origin being homozygous or compound heterozygous for this variant (Feder et al. 1996; Gallego et al. 2015; Press et al. 2016). Disease penetrance for the p.Cys282Tyr variant carriers is variable (Beutler et al. 2002; Pedersen et al. 2009; Gurrin et al. 2009), with homozygotes being at a greater risk for iron overload than compound heterozygotes (Seckington et al. 2015; Gallego et al. 2015). The p.Cys282Tyr variant affects HFE protein activity by preventing the formation of a disulfide bridge in the alpha-3 domain, which impairs the beta-2-microglobulin interaction and prevents the protein from reaching the cell surface (Feder et al. 1997). The p.Cys282Tyr variant has a frequency of 5% to 7% in Caucasians (Press et al. 2016) and is reported at a frequency of 0.06407 in the European American population of the Exome Sequencing Project. This allele frequency is high but is consistent with estimates of disease prevalence and reduced penetrance. Based on the collective evidence, the p.Cys282Tyr variant is classified as pathogenic for hereditary hemochromatosis. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.</Comment>

                <Attribute Type="public definition">HFE hemochromatosis is characterized by inappropriately high absorption of iron by the small intestinal mucosa. The phenotypic spectrum of HFE hemochromatosis includes: Persons with clinical HFE hemochromatosis, in whom manifestations of end-organ damage secondary to iron overload are present; Individuals with biochemical HFE hemochromatosis, in whom transferrin-iron saturation is increased and the only evidence of iron overload is increased serum ferritin concentration; and Non-expressing p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes, in whom neither clinical manifestations of HFE hemochromatosis nor iron overload are present. Clinical HFE hemochromatosis is characterized by excessive storage of iron in the liver, skin, pancreas, heart, joints, and anterior pituitary gland. In untreated individuals, early symptoms include: abdominal pain, weakness, lethargy, weight loss, arthralgias, diabetes mellitus; and increased risk of cirrhosis when the serum ferritin is higher than 1,000 ng/mL. Other findings may include progressive increase in skin pigmentation, congestive heart failure, and/or arrhythmias, arthritis, and hypogonadism. Clinical HFE hemochromatosis is more common in men than women.</Attribute>

                <Attribute Type="public definition">HFE hemochromatosis is characterized by inappropriately high absorption of iron by the small intestinal mucosa. The phenotypic spectrum of HFE hemochromatosis includes: Persons with clinical HFE hemochromatosis, in whom manifestations of end-organ damage secondary to iron overload are present; Individuals with biochemical HFE hemochromatosis, in whom transferrin-iron saturation is increased and the only evidence of iron overload is increased serum ferritin concentration; and Non-expressing p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes, in whom neither clinical manifestations of HFE hemochromatosis nor iron overload are present. Clinical HFE hemochromatosis is characterized by excessive storage of iron in the liver, skin, pancreas, heart, joints, and anterior pituitary gland. In untreated individuals, early symptoms include: abdominal pain, weakness, lethargy, weight loss, arthralgias, diabetes mellitus; and increased risk of cirrhosis when the serum ferritin is higher than 1,000 ng/mL. Other findings may include progressive increase in skin pigmentation, congestive heart failure, and/or arrhythmias, arthritis, and hypogonadism. Clinical HFE hemochromatosis is more common in men than women.</Attribute>

                <Attribute Type="public definition">Variegate porphyria (VP) is both a cutaneous porphyria (with chronic blistering skin lesions) and an acute porphyria (with severe episodic neurovisceral symptoms). The most common manifestation of VP is adult-onset cutaneous blistering lesions (subepidermal vesicles, bullae, and erosions that crust over and heal slowly) of sun-exposed skin, especially the hands and face. Other chronic skin findings include milia, scarring, thickening, and areas of decreased and increased skin pigmentation. Facial hyperpigmentation and hypertrichosis may occur. Cutaneous manifestations may improve in winter and be less prevalent in northern regions and in dark-skinned individuals. Acute neurovisceral symptoms can occur any time after puberty, but less often in the elderly. Acute manifestations are highly variable, but may be similar from episode to episode in a person with recurrent attacks; not all manifestations are present in a single episode; and acute symptoms may become chronic. Symptoms are more common in women than men. The most common manifestations are abdominal pain; constipation; pain in the back, chest, and extremities; anxiety; seizures; and a primarily motor neuropathy resulting in muscle weakness that may progress to quadriparesis and respiratory paralysis. Psychiatric disturbances and autonomic neuropathy can also be observed. Acute attacks may be severe and are potentially fatal.</Attribute>

Morbidities include progressive obstructive lung disease with bronchiectasis, frequent hospitalizations for pulmonary disease, pancreatic insufficiency and malnutrition, recurrent sinusitis and bronchitis, and male infertility. Pulmonary disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in CF. Meconium ileus occurs at birth in 15%-20% of newborns with CF. More than 95% of males with CF are infertile. Congenital absence of the vas deferens (CAVD) is generally identified during evaluation of infertility or as an incidental finding at the time of a surgical procedure. Hypoplasia or aplasia of the vas deferens and seminal vesicles may occur either bilaterally or unilaterally. Testicular development and function and spermatogenesis are usually normal.</Attribute>

(1996) identified a C-to-G transversion in exon 2 of the HFE gene, resulting in a his63-to-asp substitution (H63D). This variant was present in 8 of the 9 (89%) nonancestral chromosomes, representing a significant enrichment over the 17% frequency observed in control chromosomes. One patient was homozygous for the H63D variant.</Attribute>

However, 3 homozygotes with no evidence of iron overloading were found among 101 control samples derived from healthy blood donors. In addition, compound heterozygosity for the H63D and C232Y mutations was found in 3 patients and 4 controls.</Attribute>

He suggested that most of the heterozygotes with mild disease manifestations reported before discovery of the HFE gene will prove, in fact, to be compound heterozygotes for C282Y (613609.0001) and H63D.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">Aguilar-Martinez et al. (2001) investigated the phenotypic consequences of H63D homozygosity in 56 French homozygotes identified from a series of blood samples submitted for HFE genotyping in response to a confirmed (12) or suspected (38) clinical diagnosis of hemochromatosis or a family history of hemochromatosis (6). Of these, 50 (89%) had evidence of iron overload. In 16 individuals (32%) this appeared to be a phenomenon secondary to dysmetabolic iron overload syndrome, porphyria cutanea tarda, alcohol use, or hepatitis. In the remaining 34 (68%) individuals a secondary cause of iron overload was not identified: 12 had a phenotypic diagnosis of hemochromatosis and the remaining 22 had ill-defined, variable degrees of iron overload with no apparent cause. Extended genetic analysis failed to demonstrate any association between phenotype and other HFE mutations/polymorphisms or the TFR2 Y250X mutation (604720.0001)/TFR2 polymorphisms.

          <Comment>The H63D variant in the HFE gene is a common variant associated with hereditary hemochromatosis. When present in the homozygous state, H63D is associated with elevated serum transferrin and transferrin saturation, but the presence of clinical symptoms and iron overload was not increased compared to individuals without an HFE variant (Gochee et al., 2002; Feder et al., 1996). The H63D variant may be more clinically relevant when present in the compound heterozygous state with the C282Y variant, although most individuals do not develop clinical hemochromatosis symptoms, even if they have biochemical parameters consistent with hemochromatosis (Gurrin et al., 2009; Seckington and Powell, 2015). The H63D variant is observed in 18,253/126,698 alleles (14.4%) from individuals of European background, and 30,021/277,190 global alleles (10.8%) including 1992 homozygous control individuals, in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). The H63D variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. Functional studies have shown that H63D disrupts normal protein function (Nandar et al., 2013; Mitchell et al., 2011). We interpret H63D as a pathogenic variant.</Comment>

          <Comment>This sequence change replaces histidine with aspartic acid at codon 63 of the HFE protein (p.His63Asp). The histidine residue is moderately conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between histidine and aspartic acid. This variant is present in population databases (rs1799945, ExAC 14%). This is a very common, low penetrance variant that is known to contribute to hemochromatosis when present with a second pathogenic allele in HFE. An estimated 1.5% of individuals of European descent who are affected with hemochromatosis are homozygous for this variant (PMID: 11479183), however, penetrance of the homozygous genotype is very low and is associated with variable phenotypes (PMID: 24729993, 11399207, 16132052, 11358905). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 10). Experimental studies have shown that while this variant does not affect the localization of the protein on the cell surface or normal HFE interaction with its partner molecules (PMID: 9356458, 9162021), it does disrupt the ability to inhibit cellular iron release (PMID: 12429850), and causes partial loss of HFE function and increased hepatic iron loading in mice (PMID: 14673107). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic (low penetrance).</Comment>

          <Comment>The p.His63Asp variant in HFE is a well-established pathogenic variant for hered itary hemochromatosis (HH). Although it is considered pathogenic, the penetrance is significantly reduced. Biochemically, only 13% of p.His63Asp homozygotes and 17% of p.His63Asp/p.Cys282Tyr compound heterozygotes were shown to have elevate d transferrin saturation (Pederson 2009) and less than 5% of individuals with bi allelic pathogenic HFE variants exhibit clinical symptoms of HH (Beutler 2002, G urrin 2009). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as pathoge nic for HH in an autosomal recessive pattern but with significantly reduced pene trance. ACMG/AMP Criteria applied: PS3; PS4; PM3.</Comment>

          <Comment>The c.187C&gt;G (p.His63Asp) variant is well described in the literature as a pathogenic variant with significantly reduced penetrance (Seckington et al. 2015). Only two percent or fewer of individuals who are homozygous or compound heterozygous for the p.His63Asp variant are expected to develop clinical symptoms of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) (Gochee et al. 2002; Gurrin et al. 2009; Gallego et al. 2015). The p.His63Asp variant was first reported by Feder et al. (1996) in a cohort of 178 HH patients in one homozygote, eight compound heterozygotes, and nine heterozygotes where a second variant was not observed. This variant was also found in 51 of 308 control chromosomes in this study. The p.His63Asp variant is reported at a frequency of 0.25234 in the Iberian Population in Spain in the 1000 Genomes Project. This allele frequency is high but is consistent with disease prevalence, reduced penetrance, and a mild phenotype. Based on the evidence, the p.His63Asp variant is classified as a pathogenic variant with significantly reduced penetrance for hereditary hemochromatosis.</Comment>

Compound heterozygotes for p.Cys282Tyr and p.His63Asp are common in the Caucasian population, and together with homozygotes for the p.Cys282Tyr, account for 87% of individuals of European origin with HFE-HH. However, it is important to note that only ~ 0.5%-2.0% of compound heterozygous individuals develop clinical evidence of the disease due to incomplete penetrance (GeneReviews: Seckington et al., 2015; Ramrakhiani and Bacon, 1998; Morrison et al., 2003). In summary, this variant c.187C&gt;G, (p.His63Asp) meets our criteria for Pathogenic.</Comment>
